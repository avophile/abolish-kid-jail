                <p>
                    This guide walks you through every step of the IEP evaluation process, from your initial
                    request through the eligibility meeting. Understanding what to expect helps you feel
                    prepared and empowered to advocate for your child.

                    advocate, and you have important legal rights at every step.

                    <li>Consider filing a state complaint if there are significant delays without good reason</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 4: Receiving the Evaluation Report</h2>

                <h3>What You'll Receive</h3>
                <p>You should receive a comprehensive evaluation report that includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Background information:</strong> Your concerns, child's history, reason for referral</li>
                    <li><strong>Assessment results:</strong> Detailed results from each test and observation</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> What the results mean</li>
                    <li><strong>Strengths and weaknesses:</strong> Your child's profile</li>
                    <li><strong>Summary and recommendations:</strong> Whether evaluators believe your child has a disability</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Understanding Test Scores</h3>

                <div class="card" style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h4>Common Score Types</h4>

                        <li><strong>Percentile Ranks:</strong> If your child scores in the 25th percentile, they performed better than 25% of same-age peers</li>
                        <li><strong>Grade Equivalents:</strong> If your 4th grader scores at a 2nd grade level in reading, this indicates a 2-year delay</li>
                        <li><strong>Age Equivalents:</strong> Similar to grade equivalents but based on age</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Note:</strong> Scores alone don't determine eligibility - the team considers multiple factors.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>What to Do When You Receive the Report</h3>

                <div class="highlight" style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem;">

                    <li>Difficulties are due to other factors (language barriers, attendance, lack of instruction)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What to Do If You Disagree</h4>
                <p>If you believe the decision is wrong:</p>
