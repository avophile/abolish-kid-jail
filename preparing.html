                <h2>You Can Do This</h2>
                <p>
                    This guide will help you prepare for your child's manifestation determination hearing.
                    You are your child's best advocate, and with the right preparation, you can effectively
                    protect their rights and ensure they receive the support they need.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    <strong>Remember:</strong> The manifestation determination hearing is not optional—it's
                    your child's legal right under federal law. You belong in that room, and your voice matters.

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Two Key Questions</h2>
                <p>The team must answer these critical questions:</p>

                <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Question 1: Was the conduct caused by, or directly related to, the child's disability?</h3>
                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Did the disability cause or contribute to the behavior? Is there a clear connection?</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A student with ADHD impulsively grabbed another student (impulsivity is a symptom of ADHD)</li>
                        <li>A student with autism had a meltdown when routine changed (difficulty with transitions is autism-related)</li>
                        <li>A student with an emotional disturbance had an outburst when overwhelmed</li>
                        <li>A student with intellectual disability didn't understand social boundaries</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Question 2: Was the conduct a result of the school's failure to implement the IEP?</h3>
                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Was the school actually doing what the IEP required? If they had properly implemented it, would this have happened?</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IEP requires a behavior plan, but school wasn't following it</li>
                        <li>IEP specifies accommodations (breaks, small group), but teacher wasn't providing them</li>
                        <li>IEP requires check-ins with counselor, but they weren't happening</li>
                        <li>IEP specifies supports that would have prevented this, but they weren't in place</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p class="highlight" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    <strong>Critical:</strong> If the answer to EITHER question is "yes," the behavior is a manifestation of the disability, and the school CANNOT proceed with standard discipline.
                </p>

                    <li>Communications showing services weren't provided</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Prepare Your Statement</h3>
                <p>Write down (and practice saying) the following:</p>

                <h4>About Your Child:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>What triggers difficult behaviors</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>About the Incident:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your understanding of what happened</li>
                    <li>Context the school might not know (stress at home, medication change, recent trigger)</li>
                    <li>How this is typical of disability-related behaviors you've seen</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>About IEP Implementation:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any concerns about whether IEP was being followed</li>
                    <li>Specific accommodations or services that weren't being provided</li>
                    <li>Previous conversations about implementation issues</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Know Your Argument</h3>
                <p>Prepare to explain why the behavior WAS a manifestation:</p>

                <div class="card" style="margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <h4>If arguing Question 1 (caused by disability):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Point to specific disability symptoms</li>
                        <li>Give examples of how this behavior is characteristic</li>
                        <li>Reference evaluation reports that describe these challenges</li>
                        <li>Explain the connection clearly</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>If arguing Question 2 (IEP implementation failure):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify specific IEP components not implemented</li>
                        <li>Explain how proper implementation would have prevented behavior</li>
                        <li>Reference communications showing concerns</li>
                        <li>Point to documentation showing services weren't provided</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>4. Think About Questions You'll Ask</h3>
                <p>Good questions to ask during the meeting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Can you show me where in the IEP it addresses this type of behavior?"</li>
                    <li>"What accommodations were in place at the time of the incident?"</li>
                    <li>"Has the behavior plan been consistently implemented?"</li>
                    <li>"What data do you have about IEP implementation?"</li>
                    <li>"Were all services in the IEP being provided as written?"</li>
                    <li>"What antecedent strategies were used to prevent this?"</li>
                    <li>"Was my child given the breaks/support specified in the IEP?"</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                </div>

                <h3>If You Disagree</h3>
                <p>If the team says the behavior was NOT a manifestation and you disagree:</p>

                <h2>Possible Outcomes</h2>

                <h3>If Behavior IS a Manifestation</h3>
                <p>The school <strong>cannot</strong> proceed with typical discipline (expulsion). Instead:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If no FBA exists, school must conduct one</li>
                            <li>If FBA exists but BIP isn't working, must review and revise</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Must develop BIP if none exists</li>
                            <li>Must review and modify existing BIP</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Return to Placement</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Generally, student returns to previous placement</li>
                            <li>Unless parent and school agree to a change</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>IEP Meeting</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Often scheduled to address behavior concerns</li>
                            <li>May revise IEP to add supports</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>If Behavior is NOT a Manifestation</h3>
                <p>The school <strong>can</strong> proceed with discipline, but:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Educational Services Continue</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Student must continue to receive FAPE</li>
                            <li>Services must continue (in alternative setting if necessary)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Behavior Services Required</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Student must receive services to address behavior</li>
                            <li>Must include FBA and BIP services</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>You Can Appeal</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Request expedited due process hearing</li>
                            <li>Student stays in interim placement during appeal (usually)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <p>
                    <strong>You are your child's best advocate.</strong> You know your child better than anyone in that room.
                    Schools must follow federal law—manifestation determination hearings are not optional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>You are not alone.</strong> Thousands of parents successfully advocate for their children every year.
                    This process protects your child's rights and their future.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    <strong>You can do this.</strong> Your child deserves to be supported, not punished. Every student deserves a chance to learn and grow with the help they need.
