# Abolish Kid Jail

A project dedicated to advocating for the abolition of juvenile incarceration and promoting restorative justice approaches for youth.

## About

This repository contains resources, research, and advocacy materials focused on ending the practice of incarcerating children and youth. The juvenile justice system often causes more harm than healing, and this project aims to highlight alternatives and advocate for systemic change.

## Mission

- Raise awareness about the harmful effects of juvenile incarceration
- Promote restorative justice and community-based alternatives
- Support policy reform and advocacy efforts
- Provide educational resources for activists, educators, and community members

## Key Issues

- **Trauma and Mental Health**: Incarceration compounds trauma rather than addressing it
- **Racial Disparities**: Youth of color are disproportionately impacted by the juvenile justice system
- **School-to-Prison Pipeline**: Zero-tolerance policies criminalize normal youth behavior
- **Alternatives Exist**: Community-based programs, restorative justice, and support services are more effective

## Get Involved

This is a living project. Contributions, resources, and advocacy materials are welcome.

## Resources

- Research papers on juvenile justice reform
