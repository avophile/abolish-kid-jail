# Abolish Kid Jail

A web application that helps parents generate demand letters for manifestation determination hearings, protecting special education students from discriminatory disciplinary actions.

## About

This application empowers parents to advocate for their children with disabilities by generating professional PDF letters that demand manifestation determination hearings when their special education student faces suspension or other disciplinary action.

**The School-to-Prison Pipeline Starts Here** - When students with disabilities are suspended or expelled without proper consideration of their disability, it's the first step toward incarceration. This tool helps parents fight back by ensuring schools follow federal special education law (IDEA).

## What is a Manifestation Determination Hearing?

A manifestation determination hearing is a **legally required meeting** that must occur when a student with an IEP (Individualized Education Program) receives disciplinary action resulting in removal from school for more than 10 days (consecutive or cumulative).

### Purpose

The hearing team must answer two critical questions:

1. **Was the student's behavior caused by or directly and substantially related to their disability?**
2. **Was the behavior a direct result of the school district's failure to implement the student's IEP?**

If the answer to either question is "yes," the school **cannot proceed** with standard disciplinary action. Instead, they must:
- Conduct a Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) if needed
- Develop or revise the Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP)
- Provide appropriate support rather than punishment

### Why This Matters

- **Prevents discrimination** against students with disabilities
- **Stops the school-to-prison pipeline** by addressing root causes instead of punishing disability-related behavior
- **Holds schools accountable** for implementing IEPs correctly
- **Protects students** from expulsion and law enforcement involvement
- **Gives parents power** to advocate effectively for their children

### Triggering Events

A manifestation determination hearing is required when:
- Suspension or removal exceeds 10 school days (consecutive)
- Multiple suspensions total more than 10 days and create a pattern
- Student is placed in an interim alternative educational setting
- Disciplinary action constitutes a "change in placement"

## How This App Helps

This application guides parents through generating a professional, legally-informed demand letter that:

- Clearly states the legal requirement for a manifestation determination hearing
- References relevant special education law (IDEA)
- Documents the disciplinary action that triggered the requirement
- Demands the school schedule the hearing within required timeframes
- Protects the parent's rights and their child's educational rights

## Features (Planned)

- Simple questionnaire interface for parents
- Automatic letter generation based on parent input
- PDF export for printing and delivery to school
- Educational resources about manifestation determination rights
- Sample documentation templates for preparing for the hearing
- State-specific guidance where applicable

## The Bigger Picture

Every year, thousands of students with disabilities are pushed out of schools through suspensions and expulsions that don't account for their disabilities. This leads to:

- Lost educational opportunities
- Increased involvement with law enforcement
- Higher rates of juvenile justice system contact
- Long-term negative outcomes

**By helping parents demand manifestation determination hearings, we're stopping the school-to-prison pipeline at its source.**
