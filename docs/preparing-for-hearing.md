# Preparing for a Manifestation Determination Hearing

This guide helps parents prepare for the manifestation determination meeting once it has been scheduled.

## What to Expect

### Who Will Be There

The manifestation determination team includes:
- **You (Parent/Guardian)**: You have equal standing with all other team members
- **Special Education Teacher**: Teacher familiar with your child
- **General Education Teacher**: If your child has one
- **School Psychologist or District Representative**: Someone who can interpret evaluation results
- **Other District Personnel**: May include principal, vice principal, counselor, or behavior specialist

You can also bring:
- **Your Spouse or Partner**: Both parents can attend
- **An Advocate**: Someone with special education knowledge
- **An Attorney**: Especially if situation is serious
- **Others**: Anyone with knowledge or special expertise about your child (therapist, tutor, etc.)

### Meeting Format

The meeting typically follows this format:
1. **Introduction**: Team members introduce themselves
2. **Review of Incident**: School presents what happened
3. **Review of Records**: Team reviews IEP, evaluations, behavior data, teacher observations
4. **Determination**: Team discusses and answers the two key questions
5. **Decision**: Team decides if behavior was a manifestation
6. **Next Steps**: Based on the decision, team determines what happens next

### Timeline

- Must occur within **10 school days** of the decision to change placement
- Typically lasts 60-90 minutes
- You should receive written notice of the decision

## The Two Key Questions

The team must answer these questions:

### Question 1: Was the conduct caused by, or did it have a direct and substantial relationship to, the child's disability?

**What this means:**
- Did the disability cause or contribute to the behavior?
- Is there a clear connection between the disability and what happened?

**Examples:**
- A student with ADHD impulsively grabbed another student (impulsivity is a symptom of ADHD)
- A student with autism had a meltdown when routine changed (difficulty with transitions is autism-related)
- A student with an emotional disturbance had an outburst when overwhelmed (emotional regulation difficulties)
- A student with intellectual disability didn't understand social boundaries (disability affects social understanding)

### Question 2: Was the conduct a direct result of the school district's failure to implement the IEP?

**What this means:**
- Was the school actually doing what the IEP required?
- If the school had properly implemented the IEP, would this have happened?

**Examples:**
- IEP requires a behavior plan, but school wasn't following it
- IEP specifies accommodations (breaks, small group, etc.), but teacher wasn't providing them
- IEP requires check-ins with counselor, but they weren't happening
- IEP specifies supports that would have prevented the behavior, but they weren't in place

## How to Prepare

### 1. Gather Documentation

Collect and organize:

#### Your Child's Records
- Current IEP (all pages)
- All evaluations (psychological, educational, speech, OT, etc.)
- Previous IEPs
- Current and past report cards
- Progress reports
- 504 Plan (if applicable)

#### Behavior-Related Documents
- Current Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP), if one exists
- Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA), if done
- Behavior charts or tracking from school
- Communication logs (emails, notes from teacher)
- Previous disciplinary records

#### Evidence of Disability Connection
- Medical records documenting diagnosis
- Doctor's notes about symptoms
- Therapist reports
- Medication information (if relevant to behavior)
- Private evaluations

#### Evidence of Implementation Issues
- Emails showing you asked about IEP implementation
- Notes from previous IEP meetings
- Your own observations of missing supports
- Communications showing services weren't provided

### 2. Prepare Your Statement

Write down (and practice saying):

**About Your Child:**
- How the disability affects your child daily
- Specific examples of how the disability impacts behavior
- What triggers difficult behaviors
- What supports help your child succeed

**About the Incident:**
- Your understanding of what happened
- Context the school might not know (stress at home, medication change, recent trigger)
- How this is typical of disability-related behaviors you've seen

**About IEP Implementation:**
- Any concerns about whether IEP was being followed
- Specific accommodations or services that weren't being provided
- Previous conversations about implementation issues

### 3. Know Your Argument

Prepare to explain why the behavior WAS a manifestation:

**If arguing Question 1 (caused by disability):**
- Point to specific disability symptoms
- Give examples of how this behavior is characteristic
- Reference evaluation reports that describe these challenges
- Explain the connection clearly

**If arguing Question 2 (IEP implementation failure):**
- Identify specific IEP components not implemented
- Explain how proper implementation would have prevented behavior
- Reference communications showing concerns
- Point to documentation showing services weren't provided

### 4. Think About Questions You'll Ask

Good questions to ask during the meeting:
- "Can you show me where in the IEP it addresses this type of behavior?"
- "What accommodations were in place at the time of the incident?"
- "Has the behavior plan been consistently implemented?"
- "What data do you have about IEP implementation?"
- "Were all services in the IEP being provided as written?"
- "What antecedent strategies were used to prevent this?"
- "Was my child given the breaks/support specified in the IEP?"

## During the Meeting

### Your Rights
- **Participate equally**: Your input has equal weight
- **Ask questions**: Don't be afraid to ask for clarification
- **Present evidence**: Share your documents and observations
- **Take notes**: Or bring someone to take notes for you
- **Take breaks**: Request breaks if needed
- **Disagree**: You can disagree with the school's position
- **Audio record**: In most states, you can audio record (check state law)

### Tips for Success

**Do:**
- Stay calm and professional (even if frustrated)
- Stick to facts and documentation
- Clearly state your position
- Ask for clarification when confused
- Take notes of what everyone says
- Request copies of all documents discussed
- Ask about next steps and timeline

**Don't:**
- Get emotionally reactive (take breaks if needed)
- Accept statements without asking for evidence
- Agree to things you don't understand
- Sign anything at the meeting without reading carefully
- Let them rush you

### If You Disagree

If the team says the behavior was NOT a manifestation and you disagree:
- **State your disagreement clearly**: "I disagree with this determination."
- **Request written explanation**: "Please provide written documentation of this decision and the basis for it."
- **Preserve your rights**: "I am preserving all of my rights to appeal this decision."
- **Don't sign agreement**: You don't have to sign if you disagree
- **Ask about appeal process**: "What is the process for appealing this decision?"

## Possible Outcomes

### If Behavior IS a Manifestation

The school **cannot** proceed with typical discipline (expulsion). Instead:

1. **Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA)**
   - If no FBA exists, school must conduct one
   - If FBA exists but BIP isn't working, must review and revise

2. **Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP)**
   - Must develop BIP if none exists
   - Must review and modify existing BIP

3. **Return to Placement**
   - Generally, student returns to previous placement
   - Unless parent and school agree to a change

4. **IEP Meeting**
   - Often scheduled to address behavior concerns
   - May revise IEP to add supports

### If Behavior is NOT a Manifestation

The school **can** proceed with discipline, but:

1. **Educational Services Continue**
   - Student must continue to receive FAPE
   - Services must continue (in alternative setting if necessary)

2. **Diploma-Seeking Behavior Services**
   - Student must receive services to address behavior
   - Must include FBA and BIP services

3. **You Can Appeal**
   - Request expedited due process hearing
   - Student stays in interim placement during appeal (usually)

## After the Meeting

### Immediate Steps

1. **Review written decision**
   - Should receive within a few days
   - Must state: determination, reasoning, next steps

2. **Request IEP meeting if needed**
   - If behavior was manifestation, ensure FBA/BIP scheduled
   - If behavior was not manifestation, ensure services will continue

3. **Decide whether to appeal**
   - If you disagree with NOT a manifestation finding
   - Consult with attorney or advocate
   - Timeline is short (usually must request within days)

### Follow Up

- Keep all documentation organized
- Follow up in writing on any agreements
- Monitor IEP implementation going forward
- Document everything related to this incident
- Track any future behavioral issues

## When to Get Legal Help

Consider consulting a special education attorney if:
- The school refuses to conduct manifestation determination
- You expect the hearing to be adversarial
- Expulsion is being recommended
- The incident involves law enforcement
- Your child has been arrested or charged
- The school is not following proper procedures
- You disagree with the determination and want to appeal
- The stakes are very high (safety, placement, etc.)

## Resources for Finding Help

### Free or Low-Cost Advocacy
- **Parent Training and Information Centers (PTI)**: Every state has one
- **Community Parent Resource Centers (CPRC)**: In some communities
- **Disability Rights Organizations**: State-level advocacy groups
- **Legal Aid Organizations**: May handle special education cases
- **Law School Clinics**: Some have special education clinics

### Finding an Attorney
- **Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA)**: Attorney directory
- **State Bar Association**: Special education section
- **Local Special Education Parent Groups**: Ask for referrals
- **Wrightslaw**: Resources and attorney listings

## Remember

- **You are your child's best advocate**: You know your child better than anyone
- **You have legal rights**: IDEA gives parents significant rights
- **Schools must follow the law**: Manifestation determination is not optional
- **You are not alone**: Many parents navigate this process
- **It's worth fighting**: Protecting your child from inappropriate discipline matters

## Sample Questions & Answers

**Q: What if the school says it's not a manifestation because "all kids with ADHD don't hit"?**
A: The question isn't whether all kids with the disability have this behavior, but whether THIS child's disability caused or contributed to THIS behavior. Point to your child's specific evaluation results and symptoms.

**Q: What if the school says the IEP was implemented but I don't think it was?**
A: Ask for documentation: "Can you show me the data on implementation? Where is the documentation that these services were provided? Can I see the logs showing the accommodations were used?"

**Q: What if I didn't bring enough documentation?**
A: You can ask to continue the meeting at a later date to allow you to gather more information. You can also submit additional documentation after the meeting.

**Q: What if the school brings up things my child has done in the past?**
A: Keep the focus on THIS incident and whether THIS behavior was caused by the disability or IEP implementation failure. Past behavior may show a pattern but doesn't determine the current manifestation.

**Q: What if they try to blame me as a parent?**
A: Redirect to the disability and IEP: "We're here to determine if the behavior was caused by the disability or IEP implementation failure, not to discuss parenting. Let's focus on the legal questions."
