**RE: [Student Name] - Demand for Manifestation Determination Review**

Dear [Principal Name] and [Special Education Director Name]:

I am writing to formally demand that the school district conduct a manifestation determination review for my child, [Student Name], who is a student with a disability receiving special education services under an Individualized Education Program (IEP).

**Statement of Facts:**

On [Date of Incident], my child was [suspended/removed from school/other disciplinary action] for [number] days for [brief description of behavior/incident]. This disciplinary action [constitutes/contributes to] a change in placement as defined under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 34 CFR § 300.530.

[If cumulative suspensions: My child has now been suspended for a total of [number] days during this school year, which exceeds the 10-day threshold requiring a manifestation determination review.]

**Legal Requirement:**

Under IDEA regulations at 34 CFR § 300.530(e), when a student with an IEP is subject to a disciplinary removal that constitutes a change in placement, the school district must conduct a manifestation determination review. This review must occur within 10 school days of the decision to take disciplinary action.

**Demand:**

I hereby demand that the school district immediately schedule a manifestation determination meeting to:

1. Determine whether my child's conduct was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, my child's disability; and

2. Determine whether my child's conduct was the direct result of the school district's failure to implement my child's IEP.

**Required Information:**

In preparation for this meeting, I request that the school district provide me with copies of all relevant educational records, including but not limited to:

- All disciplinary records for the current school year
- My child's current IEP and all evaluations
- All teacher observations and incident reports related to the disciplinary action
- Documentation of IEP implementation
- Any behavior intervention plan (BIP) or functional behavioral assessment (FBA)
- All communications regarding this incident

**Timeline:**

IDEA requires that this manifestation determination meeting occur within 10 school days of the decision to change my child's placement. I expect to receive notice of the scheduled meeting date, time, and location within [3-5] business days.

**Preservation of Rights:**

This letter serves to preserve all of my rights and my child's rights under IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and any applicable state laws. My child should remain in their current educational placement (stay-put) pending the outcome of the manifestation determination review, unless we agree otherwise in writing.

I can be reached at [phone number] or [email address] to schedule this meeting. I expect prompt action on this matter.

Sincerely,

[Parent Signature]

## Key Elements Explained

### Change in Placement Definition

A "change in placement" occurs when:
- A student is removed for more than 10 consecutive school days
- A student is subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern because they total more than 10 school days in a school year
- The student is placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days

### Two Key Questions

The manifestation determination team must answer:
1. Was the conduct caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability?
2. Was the conduct the direct result of the school district's failure to implement the IEP?

If the answer to either question is YES, the behavior is a manifestation of the disability.

### Stay-Put Provision

During the pendency of any dispute (including manifestation determination review and any subsequent appeals), the student generally has the right to remain in their current educational placement. This is known as "stay-put."

### Timeline Importance

IDEA requires the manifestation determination to occur within 10 school days of the decision to change placement. Schools sometimes delay or ignore these requirements. The letter emphasizes this timeline to ensure compliance.

## Variations and Customization

### For Cumulative Suspensions
If the student has been suspended multiple times totaling more than 10 days, emphasize:
- List all suspension dates
- Calculate total days
- Note that cumulative suspensions can constitute a pattern requiring manifestation determination

### For Expulsion Recommendation
If the school is recommending expulsion, emphasize:
- Immediate need for manifestation determination
- Stay-put rights during the process
- Serious consequences of expulsion for a student with disabilities

### For Interim Alternative Educational Setting (IAES)
If the student has been placed in IAES for 45 days due to weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury:
- Acknowledge the IAES placement
- Still demand manifestation determination
- Note that even with IAES, protections apply if behavior is manifestation

### Follow-Up Letter (If School Doesn't Respond)
If the school doesn't schedule the meeting within a reasonable time:
- Reference the original letter and date
- Note the lack of response
- Reiterate the legal requirement
- Mention intent to file a state complaint or due process hearing if necessary

## Additional Considerations

### Delivery Method
Recommend parents:
- Email the letter (creates timestamp)
- Hand-deliver a printed copy to the principal's office (get receipt)
- Send via certified mail (for legal proof of delivery)
- Keep copies of everything

### Documentation
Parents should document:
- Date sent
- Method of delivery
- Any responses received
- Any phone calls or meetings

### Next Steps After Sending
After sending the letter:
1. Wait for school response (should be within days)
2. Prepare for the manifestation determination meeting
3. Gather supporting documentation
4. Consider bringing an advocate or attorney
5. If no response within 5 business days, follow up

### If School Denies Request
If the school claims manifestation determination isn't required:
- Request written explanation
- File state complaint with Department of Education
- Consider requesting mediation or due process hearing
- Consult with special education attorney

## Legal Citations Reference

- **34 CFR § 300.530(e)**: Manifestation determination requirements
- **34 CFR § 300.530(d)**: Change in placement definition
- **34 CFR § 300.533**: Placement during appeals (stay-put)

### Key Concepts
- **FAPE**: Free Appropriate Public Education
- **IEP**: Individualized Education Program
- **LRE**: Least Restrictive Environment
- **BIP**: Behavior Intervention Plan
- **FBA**: Functional Behavioral Assessment

## State-Specific Considerations

Some states have additional protections or requirements. The application should eventually include state-specific guidance where applicable.

Common variations:
- Different timelines (some states require faster response)
- Additional documentation requirements
- Different appeal processes
- Additional parent rights
