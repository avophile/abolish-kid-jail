                <h2>Understanding Manifestation Determination Hearings</h2>
                <p class="highlight">
                    Federal law protects students with disabilities from discriminatory discipline.
                    A manifestation determination hearing is your child's legal safeguard against
                    being punished for behavior related to their disability.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What is a Manifestation Determination Hearing?</h2>
                <p>
                    A manifestation determination hearing is a <strong>legally required meeting</strong>
                    that must occur when a student with an IEP (Individualized Education Program) faces
                    disciplinary action that results in removal from school for more than 10 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This protection is part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
                    a federal law that ensures students with disabilities receive appropriate education
                    and are not discriminated against due to their disability.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When is a Manifestation Determination Required?</h2>
                <p>A hearing is required when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your child is suspended for more than 10 consecutive school days</li>
                    <li>Your child has multiple suspensions that total more than 10 days and form a pattern</li>
                    <li>The school is recommending expulsion</li>
                    <li>Your child is placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days</li>
                    <li>Any disciplinary action that constitutes a "change in placement"</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Two Critical Questions</h2>
                <p>
                    The manifestation determination team (which includes you, teachers, and school administrators)
                    must answer these two questions:
                </p>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <h3>Question 1: Was the conduct caused by, or directly and substantially related to, the child's disability?</h3>
                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Did your child's disability cause or contribute to the behavior?</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A student with ADHD acted impulsively (impulsivity is a symptom of ADHD)</li>
                        <li>A student with autism had a meltdown when routines changed (difficulty with transitions is autism-related)</li>
                        <li>A student with an emotional disturbance had an outburst when overwhelmed</li>
                        <li>A student with intellectual disability didn't understand social boundaries</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <h3>Question 2: Was the conduct a direct result of the school's failure to implement the IEP?</h3>
                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Was the school actually following your child's IEP? If they had been, would this have happened?</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The IEP requires a behavior plan, but the school wasn't following it</li>
                        <li>The IEP specifies accommodations (breaks, small group), but teachers weren't providing them</li>
                        <li>The IEP requires check-ins with a counselor, but they weren't happening</li>
                        <li>The IEP has supports that would have prevented this, but they weren't in place</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>If the answer to EITHER question is "yes," the behavior is a manifestation of the disability.</strong>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What Happens if It IS a Manifestation?</h2>
                <p>If the team determines the behavior was a manifestation of the disability:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The school CANNOT proceed with typical discipline</strong> (suspension, expulsion)</li>
                    <li>Your child generally returns to their previous placement</li>
                    <li>The school must conduct a Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) if one hasn't been done or isn't working</li>
                    <li>The school must develop or revise a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP)</li>
                    <li>An IEP meeting should be scheduled to address the behavior and add necessary supports</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="highlight">
                    <strong>This protects your child from being punished for disability-related behavior and ensures they get support instead.</strong>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What Happens if It is NOT a Manifestation?</h2>
                <p>If the team determines the behavior was NOT a manifestation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The school CAN proceed with standard disciplinary procedures</li>
                    <li><strong>However</strong>, your child must still receive educational services (FAPE - Free Appropriate Public Education)</li>
                    <li>Services must continue even in an alternative setting</li>
                    <li>Your child must receive services to address the behavior (FBA and BIP services)</li>
                    <li><strong>You have the right to appeal</strong> through an expedited due process hearing</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why This Matters: The School-to-Prison Pipeline</h2>
                <p>
                    Students with disabilities are disproportionately suspended and expelled from school.
                    When children with disabilities are pushed out of school through inappropriate discipline:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They lose critical educational opportunities</li>
                    <li>They're more likely to get involved with law enforcement</li>
                    <li>They're at higher risk of entering the juvenile justice system</li>
                    <li>Their long-term outcomes suffer significantly</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="highlight">
                    <strong>Manifestation determination hearings exist to stop this pipeline.</strong>
                    They ensure that children aren't criminalized for behaviors related to their disabilities,
                    and that schools provide support rather than punishment.
                </p>
