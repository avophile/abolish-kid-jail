                <h2>You Have the Right to Request an Evaluation</h2>
                <p>
                    Under federal law, you have the right to request a free evaluation to determine if your child
                    is eligible for special education services. This guide explains your rights, the evaluation
                    process, and what happens next.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    <strong>Key Point:</strong> The school must respond to your request and either conduct the
                    evaluation or provide you with written explanation of why they are refusing - which is subject
                    to your right to dispute their decision.

                <h2>Your Rights Under IDEA</h2>

                <p>
                    The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal law that guarantees
                    students with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the
                    least restrictive environment.
                </p>

                <h3>Right to Request an Evaluation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You can request at any time:</strong> Parents have the right to request an evaluation whenever they suspect their child may have a disability</li>
                    <li><strong>Request must be in writing:</strong> While verbal requests are valid, written requests create a clear record and start the legal timeline</li>
                    <li><strong>School must respond:</strong> The district must respond within a "reasonable time" (typically 10-15 business days in most states)</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluation is free:</strong> The school must conduct the evaluation at no cost to you</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluation must be comprehensive:</strong> Must assess all areas of suspected disability</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>Evaluation must be completed within 60 days (or state timeline)</li>
                        <li>Team meets to review results and determine eligibility</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Option 2: School Refuses to Evaluate</strong></p>

                        <li>You have the right to dispute this decision</li>
                        <li>Options include mediation, filing a state complaint, or due process hearing</li>
                        <li>Consider getting an independent evaluation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Parental Consent and Participation</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>You can participate:</strong> You have the right to provide input and information during the evaluation</li>
                    <li><strong>You receive all results:</strong> You must receive a copy of the evaluation report</li>
                    <li><strong>You are part of the team:</strong> You participate as an equal member of the IEP team</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What the School Must Do</h3>

                    <li>Must be validated for the purpose they're being used</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Functional and Developmental Information</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must assess how the disability affects academic performance</li>
                    <li>Must consider developmental, functional, and academic information</li>
                    <li>Must include input from parents</li>

                <h2>Eligibility for Special Education</h2>

                <p>To be eligible for an IEP, a child must meet two criteria:</p>

                    <strong>Important:</strong> Having a medical diagnosis does NOT automatically qualify a child for an IEP. The disability must impact their educational performance and they must need specialized instruction.
